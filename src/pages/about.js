      Hey Thank you for visiting my site. This site is under "heavy" development. 
      Which means it might look different everytime you visit it.
      At the moment, it is built from Gatsby.js, React and theme built by https://github.com/email2vimalraj/.

      I am a full-stack developer interested in every bit of computer. 
      I actually started coding in 2014 and found this fast-changing field is quite challenging and
      fufilling. 
      I happened to spent four years with electrical engineering in National Tsing-Hua University of Taiwan.
      Although I didn't really understand what the subjects means and quite depressed in the uni, I am now
      trying to use everything I could get to be a "real full-stack developer". 
      Here I mean from atoms, logic gates, chips, PCB, up to scalable, well engineered software and system, 
      also the abstract models, maths under the hood.
