I was so lucky to be able to attend this summer and helping the video team to accomplish some tasks!

## What is debian conf?


DebConf is the Debian Project's developer conference. Where Debian developers(DDs) came from everywhere.

I wish I could contribute more and be more involved into the debian community next year in Brazil.


## What I have done?
Basically I am doing some simple tasks like handing the camera(The camera operator), the guy who plays with the PA system(audio techinician), director(controlls which camera to feed into the live-stream) during the debconf. Before the conf begins, we have to do some preparation like fixing the wirings of the conference rooms and etc.

## Made a simple fixer for opsis PC(a simple board computer)
We have a few boxes to put our opsis and opsis pc inside. We didn't have a fixture for the opsis single board PC... so we just make one!

We need to fix the single board computer onto our chassis. It should be strong enough for plug/unplugging RJ45 or similar sockets. The picture above

I spent some time with my friend "A-Jay", who is a professional of networking wiring and surveillance. And the first thing we have to deal with is to double check the correctness of the sketches(by sketchup 2017) I made.

You can find the sketch files here [sketch files on google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19-S3C6FRTcMhxX-HcGTe-zniB0OuTGXV)

This dog is the hardest part, he loves my leg. We had a hard time double checking the sketch while he's on my leg.

The factory:
