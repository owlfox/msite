## Prologue
Since I am praparing for job interview, I reckon it's good to write down what I know about IT, some notes about taking courses on the Internet and the process of developing some toy apps. I would like to get a position related to Web and GIS. Due to our understanding to IT is so different, I will try to make this series as readable as possible to people like me. Yes, Meeeee.

Let's get started from an everyday simple question:

### What for lunch?
Everytime when I deal with this question, the first thing would be google some words, get related information, like below:
1. open up an Internet browser, key in the words, hit search.
2. pick the ones that look like yours, and make decision.
3. use service provided by Google Map to get to the destination.

Besides food/cafe, nearly everything can be found on Internet nowadays by simply "Google it". And this serie of 30 days articles is my try to write down my view of the technical, engineering facts behind this process.

## Internet, browser brief introdution.
Have you ever tried to play games with your friends in an computer class while the teacher is giving lecture? Under the hood there are Ethernet, switch(not the one from Nintendo), IP, server and etc.

* Ethernet: wired media to connect your computer to the other end.
* Switch: Similar to the role of logistics, receive and send you information
* IP: an address to let the switch know where the information to send.
* Server: The computer to serve information to others, like the posistions of each player, HP of others.

As for Internet, imagine tons of computer classrooms, cellphones connected together via wired, wireless medias to ISP, submarine cables to other countries and share information to each other. Anyone in the world can access any computer connected to the Internet in practice. Google is one of the company which connects many of their computers to the Internet and provide information to others.

Q: Can you list a few Taiwanese companies involved in the Internet?
Example: ASUS, for routers, computers

## Internet Browser
Browser is the most ubiquitous way to access the Internet like the first example shown above. It's an application similar to any others for text processing, gaming running on your operating system Windows/MacOSX. It specialized in providing you the utilities to access files, medias on the Internet, through a protocol called HTTP.

And HTTP, ... We will leave it for tomorrow of that


## Preview of Tomorrow: A simple Web Application
* 3 pillars of web app: HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Build a simple Taiwan Web Map @ Codepen
0. HTTP? Domain? DNS? IP?
1. HTML, frame of the map
2. CSS, beautify it
3. JS, interactivity
